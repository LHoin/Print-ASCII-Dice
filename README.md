# Print ASCII Dice
Displays an unlimted number of ASCII dice from an array, horizontally, in the console using switch statements and loops. Each ASCII dice is 5 lines tall. By using multiple nested loops and switch statements, the program will go one line at a time, loop through the array, and print the correct line per dice, then repeat for all five lines.

This is what the function will print if 5 dice are passed in:
